# Cross Country Can Lit

The original list, at the project's conception, looked like this.
🍁 British Columbia - Sheila Watson’s The Double Hook
🍁 Northwest Territories - Robert Kroetsch’s But We Are Exiles
🍁 Alberta - O’Hagan’s Tay John, Kroetsch’s The Studhorse Man, and Thomas King’s Green Grass, Running Water
🍁 Saskatchewan - W.O. Mitchell’s Who Has Seen the Wind? and Sinclair Ross’s As for Me and My House
🍁 Manitoba - Martha Ostenso’s Wild Geese
🍁 Ontario - Alice Munro’s first collection of stories and Don Gillmor’s Mount Pleasant
🍁 Quebec - Gabrielle Roy’s The Tin Flute and Brian Moore’s Black Robe
🍁 Nunavut - Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk's Sanaaq
🍁 New Brunswick - David Adams Richard's Mercy Among the Children
🍁 Nova Scotia - Hugh MacLennan’s Barometer Rising and Alistair MacLeod’s No Great Mischief
🍁 Newfoundland and Labrador - The epic of my adopted province, Wayne Johnston’s The Colony of Unrequited Dreams, on the subject of NL’s contentious entry into Confederation with Canada
🍁 And for an aspect of Canadian experience that isn't necessarily bound by native geography, Ondaatje’s Running in the Family
.
.
From the outset, I planned to skip one province and one territory, feeling myself pretty well-acquainted with the most well-known literary output of the Yukon in the poetry of Robert Service and the fiction of (American) Jack London. And for Prince Edward Island, I didn't really think I could top Anne of Green Gables, which I read in 2017.
