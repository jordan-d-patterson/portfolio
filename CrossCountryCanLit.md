From the outset, I planned to skip one province and one territory, feeling myself pretty well-acquainted with the most well-known literary output of the Yukon in the poetry of Robert Service and the fiction of (American) Jack London. And for Prince Edward Island, I didn't really think I could top Anne of Green Gables, which I read in 2017.
