> "And when night comes, and you look back over today and see how fragmentary everything has been, and how much you planned that has gone undone, and all the reasons you have to be embarassed and ashamed: just take everything exactly as it is, put it in God's hands and leave it with Him." - Edith Stein, Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross

## Work Experience
**Associate Librarian, St. Peter's Seminary (_March 2021 - Present_)**
- Flying solo in my small library, I do library work of all kinds, from fulfilment and reference to cataloguing and acquisitions, and everything in between.  

**Cataloguing and Metadata Librarian, Memorial University of Newfoundland (_March 2018 - March 2021_)**
- As a part of the C&M team in a large research library, I provided a range of descriptive metadata services. Areas in which I particularly enjoyed working include subject analysis and classification, web archiving, institutional repositories, linked data, and research data management.

**Cataloguing Assistant (Law), Osgoode Hall Law Library, York University (_September 2014 - February 2018_)**
- After a year as a student assistant, I became the library's primary cataloguer, responsible for the description of its bibliographic materials. In this position I also designed a project in support of a reorganization project in the library's special collections.

**Rare Books Student Assistant, Osgoode Hall Law Library, York University (_September 2013 - September 2014_)**
- While still a Master's student, I worked for a year providing enhanced cataloguing the library's rare books.

## Projects
[Catholic-Indigenous Encounter: A Bibliography of Materials at the A.P. Mahoney Library](https://kings.uwo.libguides.com/c.php?g=726153)
- I started this project in June 2021, shortly after the news came out about the unmarked graves at the [Kamloops Indian Residential School.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamloops_Indian_Residential_School) Working in a library at a Catholic institution, I felt it was proper to prepare a resource to help researchers explore the historical relationship between the Indigenous peoples of Canada and the Catholic Church. While focusing on the Canadian context, the bibliography eventually developed to address the colonial aspects of the Catholic Church more broadly construed.

[The Vintage Contemporaries Bibliography](https://vintagecontemporariesbib.com/)  
- This personal project, built around my own book collection, is a descriptive bibliography of works published under the Vintage Contemporaries imprint of Random House from 1984 to 1999. It's also on Instagram: [@vintagecontemporariesbib](https://www.instagram.com/vintagecontemporariesbib/)

Wikidata
 - While I was at MUN, I spent time experimenting with small projects on Wikidata to teach myself about linked data. I logged most of this activity on my Wikidata profile, linked below.

## Reading
Since I was an wide-eyed English major in second year in 2010, I've tried to keep an accurate log of my reading. I read fewer novels than I used to. I used an Excel spreadsheet to catalogue my books and track my reading for over a decade before I decided a) to give up cataloguing my books and b) to start tracking my reading on Goodreads in 2022. I mark exceptional and formative reading experiences with a ⭐️; I define these as books without which I think I'd be a different person thinking different thoughts today.

In the summer of 2018, when I lived on the edge of the country in St. John's, Newfoundland, I started a project to read across Canada, coast to coast. Starting in British Columbia, I made it to Ontario, where I have been stuck for a long, long time. See my CanLit journey [here.](CrossCountryCanLit.md)

In 2021, I read through the Bible cover to cover using [this 52 week reading plan.](http://www.bible-reading.com/bible-plan.html). During this reading project, I found the Bible Project's book by book summary videos on the [Old Testament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALsluAKBZ-c&list=PLH0Szn1yYNeeVFodkI9J_WEATHQCwRZ0u&pp=iAQB) and the [New Testament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0BrP8bqj0c&list=PLH0Szn1yYNecanpQqdixWAm3zHdhY2kPR&pp=iAQB) to be indispensable supports. 

In 2022, I started a project to read through a selection of important writings from the Fathers of the Church, as selected by Boniface Ramsey in his book *Beginning to Read the Fathers*: [Beginning to Read the Fathers: A Reading List.](BeginningToReadTheFathers_list.md)
